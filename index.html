        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <i>How much does it cost?</i>
        <p>
            We don’t know yet! We’re providing free setup and free trial for
            select awesome organizations while we finalize pricing.
            <a href="mailto:team@fightforthefuture.org?subject=Contact+Congress+inquiry">Contact us!</a>
        </p>
        <i>Will there be a free version?</i>
        <p>
            Yes! The service will be free for small campaigns, and for organizations with near-zero budgets.
        </p>
        <i>What's the delivery rate?</i>
        <p>
            Right now it’s 70%, which is actually much better than any comparable
            option. We think we can get it to 80% within coming months, and
            ultimately to 95% and beyond.
        </p>
        <i>Is it just for US Congress? What about state governments, other countries, or regulatory agencies?</i>
        <p>
            We're happy to discuss solutions for other institutions including
            outside the US. <a href="mailto:team@fightforthefuture.org?subject=Contact+Congress+inquiry">Be in touch!</a>
        </p>
        <i>Is it open source?</i>
        <p>
            Yes! The product is built on <a href="https://github.com/efforg/phantom-of-the-capitol">Phantom of the Capitol</a> by Sina Khanifar, <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> and <a href="http://actionnetwork.org/">Action Network</a>. It includes our own <a href="https://github.com/fightforthefuture/phantom-dc-extras/">special modifications</a> that radically improve conversions and make integration with typical petition pages (and your CRM) delightfully simple.
        </p>
        <i>Will there be an API?</i>
        <p>Of course! It's not available yet, but it will look like <a href="https://github.com/fightforthefuture/phantom-dc-extras#api">this</a>.</p>
        <i>What's the difference between this and the EFF / Action Network tool?</i>
        <p>Their tool requires widgets with complex forms. This approach reduces action rates and requires significant changes to your signup pages. Our tool requires just four simple fields (name, email, zip, and street address) and integrates so easily with any CRM that we offer free setup. We needed this simplicity for our campaigns, so we built it. Now we're offering it to you!</p>
        <i>Do you really need to collect street address?</i>
        <p>Yes. 6 digit zipcodes span multiple house districts, and sometimes multiple states! Few people know their zip+4. Without street address, there's no way to know what Representative (or sometimes even Senator) to deliver to.</p>
        <i>Can we get reports on delivery?</i>
        <p>We will provide the complete list of members we can't deliver to, and the latest delivery rate. You only pay when we deliver.</p>
        <i>Who maintains the data?</i>
        <p>It's an open source project by multiple organizations, to which, if this service takes off, we expect to become a big contributor!</p>
